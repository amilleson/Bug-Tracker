# Bug-Tracker

This project was one of my first projects that I did on my own, after three weeks of learning Python. The whole server and data base is the
one that is inherent to Django. One of the things I am most proud of is adding the admin portal (which I am still working the kinks out of).
The most challenging portion of the project was getting the login and register page to switch at the click of a button, and the way I solved
that was to first try and hide it with a property in CSS, but I found that I could still see it if I were to mess around a little bit in
the inspect element, so I used JavaScript to inject and delete the code used for the login and registration portal giving it, what I think,
is a really cool and secure effect.
